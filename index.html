<div id='box' class='box'></div>

<!--
NOTE:
 It seems that casual browsing of Codepen pollutes the localStorage of other pens using localStorage. Therefore, there is a need for localStorage.clear() in the JS file, otherwise nothing will render initially due to the pollution. You can comment it out and see that it works just fine now that you are here!
